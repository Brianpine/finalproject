    	<h3>My greatest strengths are Patience, Trustworthy, Respectful, and flexible. When I am in a stressful situation, I often stop to take a step back and allow myself some time to think, plan and prioritize. For example, if I’ve got a lot of different University projects I’m working on all at once, I become more efficient with my time. I break the big tasks up into separate, individual activities, which take the longest, which I can complete quite quickly, and which have the nearest deadlines. It then becomes more manageable and far less stressful. My most outstanding achievements are giving an excellent presentation at work and mentoring my fellow student. I like to maintain a consistent level of productivity and take both my successes and failures in stride. I try to learn from both and apply that knowledge to future situations.</h3>
